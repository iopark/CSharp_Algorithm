## 3. Binary Search Tree Traversal Order 
Where Traversing means 1. Visiting the selected Data, 2. Outputting/ Extracting the relavant data from the selected Data, 
Selecting a method of Traversal means selecting specific 'order' of going through each datum. 
Generally speaking, in a Tree Data Structure, there are multiple ways of traversing through data, which is quite unlike other data structure(specifically for what I know for now, Linear DS)

There are 3 main types of Traversal Order, 
1. InOrder 
2. PreOrder 
3. PostOrder 

For the Binary Search Tree, the InOrder would make a relavant meaning in output sequence, as it would output in general ascending order
